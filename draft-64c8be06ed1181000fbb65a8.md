Before we start, I want to explain the steps that we need to make to:

* Configure AWS Cognito
    
* Add an Authentication layer to the Frontend
    
* Get AWS Cognito JSON Web Token from the Frontend
    

To create AWS Cognito User Pool you need a callback URL, which is based on Frontend URL. And you need Pool ID to configure Authentication for the Frontend.

> Note. In the production environment, you may use Route53 subdomains and domains to configure all URLs.

# Deploy AWS Cognito

## Deploy User Pool

To create AWS Cognito I will use this CFN template with a single parameter `CallbackUrl`. To set `CallbackUrl` value please use your CloudFront URL from Part 2 \[TODO ADD Link\] :

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: Static contents distribution using S3 and CloudFront.

Parameters:
  CallbackUrl:
    Type: String
    Description: Callback URL for Cognito hosting UI, example https://111111.cloudfront.net/callback.html

Resources:
  CognitoUserPool:
    Type: AWS::Cognito::UserPool
    UpdateReplacePolicy: Retain
    DeletionPolicy: Retain
    Properties:
      UserPoolName: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}-user-pool"
      MfaConfiguration: "OFF"
      AdminCreateUserConfig:
        AllowAdminCreateUserOnly: true
        UnusedAccountValidityDays: 90
      AutoVerifiedAttributes:
        - email
      Policies:
        PasswordPolicy:
          MinimumLength: 6
          RequireLowercase: false
          RequireNumbers: false
          RequireSymbols: false
          RequireUppercase: false
      Schema:
        - Name: name
          AttributeDataType: String
          Mutable: true
          Required: true
        - Name: email
          AttributeDataType: String
          Mutable: false
          Required: true
      AliasAttributes:
        - email
        - preferred_username

  CognitoUserDomain:
    Type: AWS::Cognito::UserPoolDomain
    Properties:
      Domain: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}"
      UserPoolId: !Ref CognitoUserPool
  
  CognitoUserPoolClient:
    Type: AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient
    Properties:
      ClientName: UIClient
      GenerateSecret: false
      AllowedOAuthScopes:
        - openid
      AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient: true
      CallbackURLs:
        - !Ref CallbackUrl
      DefaultRedirectURI: !Ref CallbackUrl
      AllowedOAuthFlows: 
        - code
      SupportedIdentityProviders:
        - COGNITO
      UserPoolId: !Ref CognitoUserPool

Outputs:
  CognitoPoolId:
    Value: !Ref CognitoUserPool
  OAuthClientId:
    Value: !Ref CognitoUserPoolClient
```

This AWS CloudFormation template is used to create resources related to AWS Cognito, which is a service that provides authentication, authorization, and user management for web and mobile applications. The specific resources it creates are as follows:

1. `CognitoUserPool`: A user pool in AWS Cognito. It has a custom password policy and schema. The user pool name is dynamically created based on the stack name. The schema specifies two required fields: name and email, with email being immutable (can't be changed after set). The user pool also auto-verifies email addresses and allows users to login with either email or preferred\_username.
    
2. `CognitoUserDomain`: A user pool domain associated with the user pool created above. The domain name is dynamically generated based on the stack name.
    
3. `CognitoUserPoolClient`: A client associated with the user pool, named 'UIClient'. The client is configured to allow OAuth with the 'code' flow, and the identity provider is Cognito itself. The callback and default redirect URIs are set to the value provided in the `CallbackUrl` parameter.
    

Additionally, there's a parameter:

* `CallbackUrl`: The URL where users are redirected after they complete the authentication process.
    

Finally, there are two outputs:

* `CognitoPoolId`: The ID of the created user pool.
    
* `OAuthClientId`: The ID of the created user pool client.
    

The template also utilizes several intrinsic functions provided by AWS CloudFormation. For example, `!Sub` substitutes variables within a string, `!Ref` returns the value of the specified parameter or resource, and `!GetAtt` retrieves the value of an attribute from a resource in the template.

The template also sets the `UpdateReplacePolicy` and `DeletionPolicy` of the user pool to 'Retain', which means that the user pool isn't deleted when the stack is deleted or when the user pool resource is replaced during a stack update.

The MFA configuration for the user pool is set to 'OFF', which means that multi-factor authentication isn't required for this user pool.

## Create User

Let's create our first user in the User Pool:

```bash
aws cognito-idp  admin-cre
ate-user --user-pool-id eu-central-1_RiJ6DluG8 --username test --temporary-password Priva
te-1234 --user-attributes Name=email,Value=name@example.com
```

You should get the email and command output:

```json
{
    "User": {
        "Username": "test",
        "Attributes": [
            {
                "Name": "sub",
                "Value": "432438b2-9071-7086-f5cb-9d20a4b18dda"
            },
            {
                "Name": "email",
                "Value": "name@example.com"
            }
        ],
        "UserCreateDate": "2023-08-02T11:34:24.724000+02:00",
        "UserLastModifiedDate": "2023-08-02T11:34:24.724000+02:00",
        "Enabled": true,
        "UserStatus": "FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD"
    }
}
```

# Configure Frontend with Cognito Hosted UI

I will configure new Frontend assets to use AWS Cognito Hosted UI. Please use the code from the `tutorial/part4/ui` folder \[TODO add link\].

## Install NodeJS (skippable)

Before starting you will require [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to build UI. The easy way to install a node is to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
```

Then install NodeJS

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

## Configure, build and deploy UI

Inside `tutorial/part4/ui` folder create `settings.js` file with the next content, you can use the value from the Output section of the CFN template used to deploy AWS Cognito:

```javascript
export const settings = {
    authority: 'https://cognito-idp.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/<CognitoPoolId>',
    client_id: '<OAuthClientId>',
    redirect_uri: 'https://<YOUR_NUMBER_FROM_PART_2>.cloudfront.net/callback.html',
    response_type: 'code',
    scope: 'openid',
    revokeTokenTypes: ["refresh_token"],
    automaticSilentRenew: false,
};
```

Then install libraries by running in the `tutorial/part4/ui` folder command:

```bash
npm i
```

And build the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Last step to upload the app to your S3 bucket:

```bash
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://your-uniq-stack-name-111111111
```

After accessing your CloudFront URL you should see two buttons:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690976750936/9e0d2417-1197-4672-b5e0-c8052d9a21c7.png align="center")

Figure 2. Cognito specific UI

> Note. To update your Frontend assets you may need not only to upload them to the S3 bucket, but also tell Cloudfront to invalidate Cache. You can invalidate the cache using `aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <YOUR_ID> --paths "*"` command

## Get Authorization token

Click on the Login button, you should be redirected to the hosted AWS Cognito page:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690977310250/e24b2ebb-e832-49ab-adb7-b22f4e7bc0d3.png align="center")

Figure 3. Hosted AWS Cognito UI

After changing your password you will be redirected to your CloudFront URL and in the Browser console you should find the next listing:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJqcGJZYxxxxxxxxx",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "profile": {
    "sub": "432438b2-9071-7086-f5cb-9d20a4b18dda",
    "iss": "https://cognito-idp.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/eu-central-1_RiJ6DluG8",
    "cognito:username": "test",
    "origin_jti": "4afc3b6e-f0d6-42db-af88-79568917e55f",
    "aud": "43j9e7bsvcgpbsoql017cpnl1r",
    "token_use": "id",
    "name": "Andrii",
    "exp": 1690981198,
    "iat": 1690977598,
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "state": "fd25d48d012447df9ee7b3a154c555c4",
  "session_state": null,
  "error": null,
  "error_description": null,
  "error_uri": null,
  "code": "e15b832d-f5c8-4851-b561-e0fdf603cf54",
  "scope": "openid",
  "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJ5S2RzTjYxxxxxxxx",
  "refresh_token": "eyJjdHkiOiJKV1QiLxxxxxxx",
  "expires_at": 1690981198
}
```

You need the value of `id_token` to access the Backend API. To examine JWT Token you can use [JSON Web Tokens -](https://jwt.io/) [jwt.io](http://jwt.io) website.

Everything ready to call the Backend API.

# Summary

In this article, I described how to add authentication to a frontend application using AWS Cognito as an OpenID server. I covered the steps to configure AWS Cognito, add an authentication layer to the Frontend, and obtain a JSON Web Token. I also provided an AWS CloudFormation template to create the necessary resources and guide you through creating a user, configuring the Frontend with Cognito Hosted UI, and obtaining an authorization token.

In the next Part, I'll show you how to connect all moving parts.
