# Introduction

This article will discuss configuring an environment to work with Generative AI on a Graph Database.

My use case is not yet here. I want to develop a closed system to analyze and advise on project dependencies. Long story short - "Talk to your dependencies". Currently, the main blocker is the ability to import [maven dependecy:tree](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/tree-mojo.html) [graphml](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) to [AWS Neptune](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/get-started-loading.html). I already submitted the bug to [Issues with Importing GraphML File in AWS Neptune Engine 1.2.1.0 · Issue #335 · awslabs/amazon-neptune-tools (github.com)](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-neptune-tools/issues/335)

The good news is that using [Gremlin query language](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html) to create your graph is working as a charm.

# Result

For your dear reader, I want to show the result that I got so you can decide if this article is for you.  
After building a graph about "English Premier League" from [graph-notebook/src/graph\_notebook/notebooks/02-Visualization/EPL-Gremlin.ipynb at main · aws/graph-notebook (github.com)](https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook/blob/main/src/graph_notebook/notebooks/02-Visualization/EPL-Gremlin.ipynb)  
I asked what [AWS Bedrock (Claude 2)](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) may say about this Graph and got an answer:

> Based on the information provided, I have the following details about the graph:
> 
> The graph contains nodes representing English Premier League teams, their home stadiums, and the cities where they are located.
> 
> There are 20 teams: Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, Liverpool, Everton, Manchester United, Manchester City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Burnley, Sheffield United, Crystal Palace, Southampton, Newcastle United, Brighton and Hove Albion, Watford, Bournemouth, Aston Villa, Leicester City, Norwich City
> 
> Each team node has properties like founded year, full name, nickname etc.
> 
> There are stadium nodes for each team's home stadium with properties like opening year, capacity, name.
> 
> There are city nodes for the city where each team is located.
> 
> All nodes have labels like 'Team', 'Stadium', 'City' to categorize them.
> 
> The nodes and properties provide information about EPL teams, their home stadiums and cities. The graph models real-world entities and relationships between them.

# ⚠️☢️☣️!!! WARNING !!!⚠️☢️☣️

> **Note 1.** UNSECURE. This setup shows you how to overcome AWS Neptune connection to instances inside the same VPC. Limiting your Security Group to your IP and enabling IAM permissions is the way to mitigate this issue.
> 
> **Note 2.** MONEY. Because AI needs access to graph schema, thus requires access to statistics, which requires RAM, cheap/free tier instances t3 and t4 are NOT an option, please check [Managing statistics for the Neptune DFE to use - Amazon Neptune](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/neptune-dfe-statistics.html)

# Bumps on the road

## AWS Neptune graph database access

While creating Neptune instance, please keep in mind two aspects:

* It's important to use engine 1.2 to get graph schema
    
* It's important to use bigger instances like db.r5.large, NOT t3 or t4, because by default graph statistics is disabled on this instances
    

## HAProxy role

According to AWS, your Neptune instance is reachable from VPC only, all AWS examples are based on running EC2 instances in the same VPC that your Neptune instance.

If you want to use your external machine with Neptune, according to [Connecting to Amazon Neptune from Clients Outside the Neptune VPC | aws-dbs-refarch-graph (aws-samples.github.io)](https://aws-samples.github.io/aws-dbs-refarch-graph/src/connecting-using-a-load-balancer/) proxying queries is option, UNSECURE by default option.

So to configure this option, you need an AWS EC2 instance, a free tire t2 instance is OK.

Install HAproxy and add these lines to your config:

```bash
frontend gremlin_proxy
    bind *:8182
    default_backend neptune_gremlin

backend neptune_gremlin
    mode http
    server neptune_server db-endpoint.cluster-xxxxx.region.neptune.amazonaws.com:8182 ssl verify none
```

Maybe you want to add Elastic IP to your EC2 instance so you can reuse same config after EC2 restarts.

Please follow me to configure your app with HAProxy

## Gremlin Console and Java app

The connection configuration is similar here.

Please use the same minor versions between your server and client. You can use a URL for your HAProxy like `ec2-xxxxx.region.compute.amazonaws.com:8182/status` to get a version of the server gremlin. It's important because of serializers.

For example, in version 3.7 gremlin-driver changes the package name of serializers in comparison to version 3.6.

To connect to your AWS Neptune Gremlin Server you need two files:

**remote-graph.properties** for java

```ini
gremlin.remote.remoteConnectionClass=org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.remote.DriverRemoteConnection
gremlin.remote.driver.clusterFile=conf/remote-objects.yaml
gremlin.remote.driver.sourceName=g
```

**remote-objects.yaml**

```yaml
hosts: [ "haproxy-ec2-instance.compute.amazonaws.com" ]
port: 8182
connectionPool: { enableSsl: false }
serializer: {
  className: org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.util.ser.GraphBinaryMessageSerializerV1,
  config: { ioRegistries: [ org.janusgraph.graphdb.tinkerpop.JanusGraphIoRegistry ] } }
```

Please notice that I'm using raw HTTP and `className` is a serializer class path that is still outdated for the latest gremlin 3.7.0 (don't use it yet), use 3.6.

## Graph Notebook with Jupyter Lab

Here is is simple:

1. Don't mess with your Python environment - use [pyenv/pyenv: Simple Python version management (github.com)](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
    
2. Install all dev packages so your Python has all features enabled
    
3. Install python version 3.10, NOT NOT NOT 3.11
    
4. Follow [aws/graph-notebook: Library extending Jupyter notebooks to integrate with Apache TinkerPop, openCypher, and RDF SPARQL. (github.com)](https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook) Readme to pip install "jupyterlab&gt;=3,&lt;4", version 3 is stable, NOT 4
    

# Finally something interesting

After you manage to install and configure all moving parts here sample notebook to configure the connection to AWS Neptune:

```python
%graph_notebook_config
{
  "host": "ec2-haproxy.region.compute.amazonaws.com",
  "port": 8182,
  "ssl": False,
  "gremlin": {
    "traversal_source": "g",
    "message_serializer": "graphsonv3"
  }
}
%status
%%gremlin
g.V().count()
```

Then please use [graph-notebook/src/graph\_notebook/notebooks/02-Visualization/EPL-Gremlin.ipynb at main · aws/graph-notebook (github.com)](https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook/blob/main/src/graph_notebook/notebooks/02-Visualization/EPL-Gremlin.ipynb) to create your first graph.

# Here comes AI

After you build your foundation you can "copy/paste" example from [Neptune Open Cypher QA Chain | 🦜️🔗 Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/graph/neptune_cypher_qa)

```python
from langchain.graphs import NeptuneGraph

host = "ec2-haproxy.region.compute.amazonaws.com"
port = 8182
use_https = False
graph = NeptuneGraph(host=host, port=port, use_https=use_https)

import boto3
boto3_bedrock  = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", 'us-east-1')
from langchain.llms.bedrock import Bedrock
llm = Bedrock(
    model_id="anthropic.claude-v2",
    model_kwargs={
        "temperature": 0,
        "top_k": 250,
        "top_p": 1,  
    },
    client=boto3_bedrock,
)

chain = NeptuneOpenCypherQAChain.from_llm(llm=llm, graph=graph)

graph = NeptuneGraph(host=host, port=port, use_https=use_https)
chain.run("What information do you have about graph? ")
```
