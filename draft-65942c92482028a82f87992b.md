## Introduction

In this article, we aim to empower individuals who face limitations in using publicly hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) by guiding them through the process of running their own local Generative AI chatbot. The guide focuses on Windows 10/11 PCs and CPU-only use cases using LLM Garden - a platform that offers a variety of open-source LLMs. By the end of this guide, you will be able to run a ChatGPT-like LLM locally, thereby making the most out of AI advancements. Let's get started!

It's best to start the article with the result:

The idea is to give anyone with different limitations to using publically hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) the ability to use them. Especially during the period of formulating yearly objectives :)

This will guide you through running your own local ChatGPT like LLM with LLM Garden - you can choose not only one but [any or all open-source LLMs from the model list](https://ollama.ai/library).

I'll focus on Windows 10/11 PCs because if you are a Mac or Linux user - you are already halfway there. I'll focus on CPU-only use cases. A separate article will cover GPU-powered cases.

## Prerequisites

We spoke about what you get, let's talk about what you need:

1. Admin access to your Windows 10 or 11
    
2. At least 16 GB of RAM
    
3. Basic knowledge of [Bash](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/bash-scripting-tutorial-linux-shell-script-and-command-line-for-beginners/)
    

Let's go!

## Guide

As the world of AI continues to expand, having tools like ChatGPT at your fingertips is becoming increasingly valuable. This guide will walk tech enthusiasts and professionals wanting to run a ChatGPT-like chatbot locally on a Windows 10 or 11 machine through the process. We'll be leveraging the power of Ubuntu 22.04 on Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) and installing Ollama, a framework for running large language models like [Meta Llama2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b).

### Step 1: Install Ubuntu 22.04 on Windows WSL2

The first step involves setting up Ubuntu 22.04 on Windows 10 or 11 using WSL2. WSL2 is a lightweight virtual machine that allows you to run a Linux kernel alongside your Windows OS. Follow the comprehensive guide on [Ubuntu's official tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview) to get Ubuntu up and running on your system.

> Note. !!!! SUPER importent step !!!

Create file called `.wslconfig` in C:\\Users\\USER\_NAME folder, with content:

```ini
[wsl2]
memory=12GB
```

I recommend to allocate ~80% of available RAM to your WSL2 Ubuntu instance. LLMs are RAM-hungry.

> Note. !!!! SUPER importent step!!!

### Step 2: Installing Ollama on Ubuntu 22.04 in WSL2

Once you have Ubuntu installed, the next step is to install [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama). Ollama is a framework specifically designed to run large language models that power generative AI applications. To install Ollama, use the following command in your Ubuntu terminal:

```bash
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

For detailed instructions and troubleshooting, visit the [Ollama GitHub page](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama).

### Step 3: **Installing NodeJs on Ubuntu**

Installing Node.js can be done similarly:

1. **Open Terminal**
    
2. **Update Package List**: It's essential to start with an updated package list:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
    
    **Install Node.js**: Use the following command to install Node.js:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install nodejs
    ```
    
3. **Verify Installation**: After installation, check the installed version of Node.js:
    
    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
    
4. **Install NPM (Node Package Manager)**: NPM manages packages for Node.js. To install it, use:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install npm
    ```
    
    After installation, verify it by checking the NPM version:
    
    ```bash
    npm --version
    ```
    

### Step 4: Installing Ollama-Web on Ubuntu 22.04 in WSL2

After installing Ollama, you'll need to set up Node.js and [Ollama-Webui](https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui). Ollama-web provides a user interface to interact with the Ollama model garden. Follow these steps to launch the web interface:

1. Clone the Ollama-Webui repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui.git
    cd ollama-webui/
    ```
    
2. Copy the required `.env` file:
    
    ```bash
    cp -RPp example.env .env
    ```
    
3. Build the frontend:
    
    ```bash
    npm i
    npm run build
    ```
    
4. Serve the frontend with the backend:
    
    ```bash
    cd ./backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    sh start.sh
    ```
    

For more information, refer to the [Ollama-web GitHub page](https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui).

### Step 5: Download the Model and use IT

Open your browser \`[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)\`. During the first load, you will be asked to create user. This first user will have SuperAdmin access.

It's not over yet - you need to download your model. Click on the gear icon, insert `llama2:7b` a model name into the Pull model input and click the green button. Wait...

## Model Garden

Ollama offers a lot of LLMs for you - look what it offers - [library (ollama.ai)](https://ollama.ai/library)!

## Conclusion

In conclusion, running ChatGPT locally on Windows 10/11 is made simple with the use of Ubuntu 22.04 on Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2), the Ollama framework, Node.js, and the Ollama-Web user interface. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the process, detailing how to set up the necessary software and download the desired language model. This method mainly benefits those restricted from publicly hosted Large Language Models. However, the prerequisites include having administrative access to your Windows, a basic understanding of Bash, and a minimum of 16GB of RAM.
