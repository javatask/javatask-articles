# Introduction

In this part, a lot will happen to build our Secure Rest API for the Backend. We need a private container registry, a specific script to configure our Linux Virtual Machine (AWS EC2 instance) and finally, we need to configure [API Gateway](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html) to proxy our requests to our VM with Rest API server (Figure 1).

# API Gateway

A curious reader may ask - why do we need API Gateway?! Our Rest API server can serve requests on its own, why do we need one more moving part? Let's answer this question.

What is the API gateway pattern and what are the benefits of using it?

If you are developing an application with multiple client backends, you may want to use the API gateway pattern to simplify and optimize the communication between the clients and the backends. The API gateway pattern is an architectural pattern that provides a single entry point for clients to access the backends, hiding the implementation details and providing additional functionality such as **authentication**, **authorization**, **load balancing**, **caching**, **logging**, **monitoring**, etc.

The API gateway pattern is similar to the facade pattern from object-oriented design, but it is part of a distributed system that uses a reverse proxy or gateway routing, and a synchronous communication model. The API gateway acts as a reverse proxy that redirects or routes requests to the internal backend endpoints, based on some predefined rules. The API gateway also translates the requests and responses between the clients and the backends, using different types, formats, protocols, etc.

The API gateway pattern has several benefits for applications, such as:

* It simplifies client-side development by providing a uniform and consistent interface for accessing the backends, regardless of their number, location, or technology.
    
* It reduces network latency and bandwidth consumption by aggregating and transforming data from multiple backends into a single response for the client.
    
* It improves the security and reliability of the application by implementing common features such as authentication, authorization, encryption, rate limiting, circuit breaking, retrying, etc. at the gateway level, rather than at each backend.
    
* It enables scalability and flexibility of the application by allowing dynamic routing and discovery of backends, as well as adding or removing backends without affecting the clients.
    
* It facilitates monitoring and logging of the application by collecting and analyzing metrics and traces from the gateway and the backends.
    

In conclusion, the API gateway pattern is a useful design pattern for building applications with multiple backends. It provides a single entry point for clients to access the backends, hiding the implementation details and providing additional functionality. It also simplifies client-side development, reduces network latency and bandwidth consumption, improves the security and reliability of the application, enables scalability and flexibility of the application, and facilitates monitoring and logging of the application.

For use, the API gateway is important as a point of decoupling Backend hosting options from Frontend. We can do drastic changes in Backend hosting without affecting Frontend implementation.

Now we know why we need API Gateway, we need a private container registry to jump to our Cloudformation (CFN) template.

# Private container registry

To unify the process of the deployment of our "complex" backend I'll use containerization. To keep this approach secure, so you can use your enterprise containers, I'll use a private container registry.

To create a private Elastic Service Registry (ECR), run this command.

```bash
 aws ecr create-repository --repository-name rest-api
```

I would offer you to check AWS ECR UI/Console for the instructions to log in, build and push your custom container. As for 2023 next commands were used:

1. Retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry.
    
    Use the AWS CLI: `aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-central-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 1111111111.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`
    
2. Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-container-image.html). You can skip this step if your image is already built:
    
    `docker build -t test .`
    
3. After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository: `docker tag test:latest 11111111.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/test:latest`
    
4. Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
    
    `docker push 11111111111.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/test:latest`
    

You would need your container URI `11111111111.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/test:latest` to deploy Backend.

Let's deploy the Backend.

# Deploy the Backend

For the deployment, we will use a Cloudformation (CFN) template file called `api-backend.yaml` . You need to set the value of the `ContainerURI` parameter to point to your container URI.

> Note. *You need to change AWS::EC2::Instance InstanceType and/or ImageId if you deploy this template in another region or with another architecture. I tested this template in* `eu-central-1` region.

This AWS CloudFormation template does several things related to deploying an API backend using an Amazon EC2 instance, which uses Docker to pull and run a specific container, and exposes the API via an Amazon API Gateway.

**EC2 Instance Configuration:**

* Defines a Docker image (ContainerURI) to be pulled from an Amazon ECR repository. The Docker image is the back-end REST API application.
    
* Creates an EC2 instance with type `t2.micro` using an AMI image specified by the `ImageId` parameter.
    
* The EC2 instance is associated with an IAM instance profile (EC2InstanceProfile), which allows the instance to pull Docker images from ECR.
    
* The EC2 instance belongs to a security group (EC2SecurityGroup) which allows inbound HTTP traffic on port 8080.
    
* Executes a startup script (UserData) that updates the instance, installs Docker, starts Docker, logs into ECR, pulls the Docker image, and then runs the Docker container exposing the application on port 8080.
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo dnf -y update
    sudo dnf -y install docker
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    aws ecr get-login-password --region ${AWS::Region} | sudo docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${AWS::AccountId}.dkr.ecr.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com
    sudo docker pull ${ContainerURI}
    sudo docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ${ContainerURI}
    ```
    

**IAM Role and Instance Profile Configuration:**

* Creates an IAM role (EC2Role) for EC2 service that allows the service to assume the role. The role has the managed policy `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly` attached, which grants read-only access to Amazon ECR.
    
* Associates the EC2 instance with this IAM role by creating an IAM instance profile (EC2InstanceProfile) and associating the IAM role with it.
    

**Security Group Configuration:**

* Creates a security group (EC2SecurityGroup) for the EC2 instance. The security group allows inbound traffic for TCP on port 8080 from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0).
    

**API Gateway Configuration:**

* Creates an API Gateway (ApiGatewayRestApi), a resource (ApiGatewayResource), and an HTTP method (ApiGatewayMethod) that accepts any HTTP verb and does not require authentication (AuthorizationType: NONE).
    
* The integration type is HTTP\_PROXY, which means the API Gateway is setup as a proxy to the EC2 instance. The Uri property dynamically references the public DNS name of the EC2 instance, with a path parameter {proxy}, allowing it to pass requests to the backend service running in the Docker container on the EC2 instance.
    
* Deploys the API Gateway (ApiGatewayDeployment) to a stage named 'production'.
    

**Outputs:**

* The template outputs the instance ID of the EC2 instance and the URL of the API Gateway in the 'production' stage.
    

This setup can be useful for creating a publicly accessible REST API that is served by a containerized application running on an EC2 instance.

Let's test our newly deployed Backend.

```bash
curl https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/production/api/greeting
```

You should get

```json
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
```

# Drawbacks of EC2 as a Backend

This section will highly the main drawbacks of this configuration and the way of mitigation.

My EC2 Instance and API Gateway URL both has publically reachable URL. It's quite easy to fix by disabling Public IP, Api Gateway VPC Link, adding Authorizer to Api Gateway and putting it behind AWS Cloudfront.

But it's more complex to fix workflow for pushing new versions of your backend implementation. Here I'm talking about [blue-green deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/bluegreen-deployments.html) or [rolling deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/rolling-deployments.html). There is no easy way to build a CI/CD pipeline apart from hiding EC2 behind the Load Balancer and building new AMI images with the latest version of your Backend container.

I showed you this way as maybe a more developer-focused approach that enables easy debugging of different moving parts of your application.

# Summary

In this article, we discuss how to build a secure REST API for the backend using a private container registry, a script to configure a Linux Virtual Machine (AWS EC2 instance), and API Gateway to proxy requests to the REST API server. We explain the benefits of using the API gateway pattern, such as simplifying client-side development, improving security and reliability, and enabling scalability. We then provide a step-by-step guide on creating a private Elastic Service Registry (ECR), deploying the backend using a CloudFormation template, and testing the deployed backend. Finally, we discuss the drawbacks and potential improvements for this configuration.

Nevertheless, in the next part, we will add an Authentication layer with AWS Cognito to our Backend and bind our Backend to the Frontend to get an E2E experience.
