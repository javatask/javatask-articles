Now you have containers, how to ship them? Evaluating AWS App Runner, ECS, and EKS on Fargate for a Classic Single-Page App

# Introduction

As with any IT solution generic discussions about where to run your containers may always come to the same answer "It depends". It depends on the size, it depends on the skill set, it depends on time, budget etc.

In this article, I want to focus on the specific use case of migrating production on-prem single-page applications (SPA) to the cloud. An important aspect of this series is that it tries to be as technical neutral as possible. You can build your static assets for Frontend with any framework you like, or use raw HTML. You can you any language to build your Backend, the only requirement is to expose business logic via REST API.

# Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial you will need:

* AWS CLI - [Command Line Interface - AWS CLI - AWS (](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)[amazon.com](http://amazon.com)[)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
    
* Frontend - static web assets for your [SPA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) - index.html, *js,* css and other files
    
* Backend - [REST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST) API server packed as a [container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/#:~:text=A%20Docker%20container%20image%20is,tools%2C%20system%20libraries%20and%20settings.)
    

That is all you need.

# Interesting part

A big part of this series is related to sharing the pros and cons of six options to host your Backend. The options are:

1. **EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud): Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable computing capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch and manage virtual machines, known as instances, on the AWS cloud infrastructure. EC2 offers flexibility in selecting instance types, operating systems, and security configurations, making it a popular choice for running a wide range of applications.
    
2. **AppRunner**: AWS AppRunner is a fully managed service that simplifies containerized application deployment. With AppRunner, developers can quickly build, deploy, and scale applications without manual configurations. It automatically handles tasks like capacity provisioning, load balancing, and scaling, enabling developers to focus on writing code and accelerating their development workflows.
    
3. **ECS** (Elastic Container Service): Amazon ECS is a scalable container orchestration service designed to manage Docker containers. It allows users to run quickly and scale containerized applications on a cluster of EC2 instances or AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers. ECS simplifies container deployment, load balancing, and monitoring, making it an ideal choice for containerized application environments.
    
4. **EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Amazon EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service that makes running, managing, and scaling containerized applications easier using Kubernetes on AWS. EKS eliminates the need for managing Kubernetes control plane infrastructure, providing a highly available and secure platform for deploying containerized workloads. It offers seamless integration with other AWS services and allows users to focus on building applications rather than managing Kubernetes infrastructure.
    
5. **Lambdas / Serverless** (AWS Lambda): AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that enables developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. With Lambda, users can upload their code, and it automatically handles the execution based on incoming events or triggers. It scales automatically, responding to demand, and users only pay for the compute time consumed by their functions. This serverless approach simplifies application development and reduces operational overhead, allowing developers to build event-driven, scalable applications easily.
    
6. On-prem - using only nginx, for air-gapped scenarios.
    

# Use case

SPA is a classic three-layered architecture (Figure 1.). To work with a "real" application I'll use a combination of HTML files as a Frontend and for the Backend I'll stick to [Spring Boot Tutorial Rest API app](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-rest-service/tree/main/complete). All code for each increment is available in my git repository \[TODO add link\].

Figure 1. Single-page application (Link to the Wikipedia)

Application migration will be done in the next steps:

1. Host our static assets with Cloudfront and S3 services. At this point, our goal is to get our Frontend running on a publically available httpS URL
    
2. The next step is to get an independent URL for our Backend and test it
    
3. Then we will connect our Backend URL on `/api` path on the main Frontend URL to enable [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX) calls.
    
4. The last step is to add Sign In functionality and protect our Backend URL with the JWT Authorization header. This means that Backend API will reject all requests without valid JWT.
    

Please check Figure 2. and Figure 3. for the whole architecture and interaction.

Figure 3. Sequence diagram of interactions between moving parts

Description of the Sequence diagram:

1. The user requests a webpage, which is served by CloudFront, fetching static files from the S3 bucket.
    
2. When the user makes an API request, CloudFront forwards it to the API Gateway.
    
3. The API Gateway checks with Cognito to verify the authentication of the request.
    
4. If authentication is successful, the request is processed by Backend, which may fetch or store data from the Database. The processed data is then returned to the user via API Gateway and CloudFront.
    
5. If authentication fails, an error message is returned to the user.
