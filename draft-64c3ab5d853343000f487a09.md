# Introduction

This part has required steps to deploy infrastructure to host static assets of your app Frontend.

# Use case part

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690547418566/72ae729d-1b89-4e64-ad79-ffed8a162ba3.png align="center")

Figure 1. Static hosting with Cloudfront and S3

Figure 1. shows that we will deploy to core resources - Cloudfront distribution and S3 bucket.

To deploy these resources we will use [Infrastructure as a code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) (IaC) approach. IaC gives you the ability to describe as code your infrastructure, pass this file to the service and here you have your resources. AWS service name responsible for the IaC is Cloudformation (CFN). I'll use CFN to create Cloudfront distribution and S3 bucket for secure static hosting.

Let's go straight to the practice.

Code Listing 1. AWS Cloudformation template to deploy resources for secure static hosting.

To start the deployment process of CFN template (Code Listing 1.) use the next command:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name your-uniq-stack-name --template-body file://cdn.yaml
```

> Note. It's important to use lower case stack name because I'm using it to generate a unique S3 bucket name. And s3 requires only lowercase characters.

To check the status of your CFN stack please run:

```bash
 aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name your-uniq-stack-name
```

You need to wait for the stack status `CREATE_COMPLETE`. After creation please run the command to get Stack outputs:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name your-uniq-stack-name --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'
```

You should get the next output:

```yaml
[
    {
        "OutputKey": "BucketWithStaticAssets",
        "OutputValue": "your-uniq-stack-name-11111111"
    },
    {
        "OutputKey": "URL",
        "OutputValue": "https://xxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net"
    }
]
```

This output gives you the ability to upload static assets to an S3 bucket and access them via `https://xxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net` URL.

> ⚠Warning⚠
> 
> You need to wait 4-12 hours for DNS propagation. If you try to access Cloudfront URL you may get a "Permission denied" exception and you will see a "raw" S3 URL. This means that DNS is not yet ready - please Wait.
> 
> ⚠Warning⚠

Before describing every resource in CFN template we need to upload `index.html` to our newly created S3 bucket.

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>oidc-client-ts Example</title>
</head>

<body>
    <button id="login">Login</button>
    <div id="outputDiv"></div>
    <button id="getdata">Fetch Data</button>
</body>

</html>
```

```bash
 aws s3 cp index.html s3://your-uniq-stack-name-11111111
```

To list files in your S3 bucket please use

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://your-uniq-stack-name-111111111
```

Be patient and you will see a simple html page on your Cloudfront URL.

No, let's jump to the CFN template.

# Please explain the Cloudfromation template code listing!

This is a CloudFormation template for distributing static content using Amazon S3 and CloudFront. Here's a general overview of the various components of this template:

* **Parameters**: The parameter `CachePolicy` is defined that can be used to specify a cache policy. The default value is `CachingDisabled`, but it can be changed to any of the allowed values listed.
    
* **Mappings**: CachePolicyIds mapping is defined for each possible cache policy value, mapping them to their respective policy ID.
    
* **Resources**:
    
    * `AssetsBucket`: An Amazon S3 bucket is created where the static content will be stored. The bucket name is composed of the stack name and the AWS account ID. The bucket has server-side AES256 encryption enabled and public access is blocked. S3 bucket logging is enabled with the logs stored in `AccessLogBucket`.
        
    * `AssetsBucketPolicy`: A bucket policy for the above S3 bucket that allows CloudFront to fetch objects from this bucket (GetObject action). It also includes a statement to deny all S3 actions if the request is not made over a secure (SSL/TLS) connection.
        
    * `AccessLogBucket`: Another S3 bucket is created specifically for storing access logs from `AssetsBucket`. The bucket name includes the stack name, AWS account ID, and the '-logs' suffix. The bucket has a lifecycle rule configured to move objects to the STANDARD\_IA storage class after 30 days and delete them after 2 years. This bucket also has server-side AES256 encryption enabled and public access is blocked.
        
    * `AccessLogBucketPolicy`: A bucket policy for the log bucket to deny all S3 actions if the request is not made over a secure (SSL/TLS) connection.
        
    * `AssetsDistribution`: A CloudFront distribution is created for content delivery. It uses the S3 bucket as its origin and implements the cache policy specified by the `CachePolicy` parameter. The default root object is set to `index.html` and the viewer protocol policy is set to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. It also uses the HTTP/2 protocol, with the viewer certificate set to the default CloudFront certificate.
        
    * `CloudFrontOriginAccessControl`: A CloudFront origin access control is set up, configured for S3, with `always` signing behaviour and sigv4 signing protocol.
        
* **Outputs**: The stack outputs the name of the S3 bucket used to store static assets and the URL of the CloudFront distribution.
    

This CloudFormation template can be used to quickly set up an S3 bucket and a CloudFront distribution to serve static assets securely and efficiently.

# Summary

In this article, we provide a step-by-step guide on how to deploy a secure static hosting infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation, Amazon S3, and CloudFront. We cover the creation of an S3 bucket for storing static assets, setting up a CloudFront distribution for content delivery, and configuring cache policies and security settings. The provided CloudFormation template can be easily customized to fit your specific use case, enabling you to quickly set up a secure and efficient static hosting solution for your app Frontend.
