# Introduction

The EU Digital Identity Wallet (EU DIW) is a revolutionary tool that can be utilized to authenticate Business APIs and Business data stores for AI Agents, transforming them into Machine Customers. This transformation is a significant shift in the marketing and sales landscape, moving from human-centric operations to programming-centric ones.

This article was inspired by Gartners - Machine Customers Will Decide Who Gets Their Trillion-Dollar Business. Is It You?

## Machine Customers

The rise of AI has led to the emergence of Machine Customers, AI agents that interact with businesses, make purchases, and use services on behalf of humans.

## Marketing Evolves

The advent of Machine Customers necessitates a shift in marketing strategies. Traditional methods focusing on human emotions and psychology may not be as effective. Instead, marketing strategies need to be data-driven and tailored to the preferences and behaviours of AI agents.

## Sales Shifts From People to Programming

The sales process is also significantly shifting. Instead of human sales representatives, businesses will need to develop sophisticated programming to cater to the needs of Machine Customers. This includes creating APIs that interact with AI agents and process transactions seamlessly.

## Integration of AI and API using Digital Wallet

The EU DIW can play a crucial role in this transformation. By providing a secure and reliable mechanism for AI agents to authenticate to Business APIs and data stores, the EU DIW can facilitate seamless interactions between businesses and Machine Customers.

## What AI is capable of?

AI has the potential to revolutionize the way businesses operate. With the ability to process vast amounts of data and make real-time decisions, AI agents can provide personalized experiences to human customers and streamline business operations.

# Recommendations

* Build OpenID server on top of LOTL, including third country's TLs
    
* Build standard mapping of attestation attributes to OAuth2 token custom properties. Make it configurable
    
* Implement sample LOTL authenticators for big players like AWS, GCP, Azure API gateways, etc
    
* Promote EU EID as a safe, automated and interoperable place for storing all critical data about legal entity
    
* Promote the integration of Legal EU EID into software for SMEs and Enterprise
