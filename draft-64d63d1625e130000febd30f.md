# Introduction

This part of the series is focused on running your backend in a production environment. Another goal is to give you tooling to fulfil the Observable, Seamslessly updatable and failure Tolerant criteria of Cloud Ready App (Here I'm talking about FROSST criteria from [Cloud Strategy - A Decision-based Approach to Successful Cloud Migration - The Architect Elevator](https://architectelevator.com/book/cloudstrategy/) Book).

# Before Cloudformation (CFN) template

There is a need to get ARN (ID) for the observability configuration. use This command to create a config:

```bash
aws apprunner create-observability-configuration --observability-configuration-name
rest-api  --trace-configuration Vendor=AWSXRAY
```

Get ARN from `ObservabilityConfigurationArn` value of the output:

```json
{
    "ObservabilityConfiguration": {
        "ObservabilityConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:eu-central-1:1111111111:observabilityconfiguration/rest-api/1/9381639c7e28417c8e4408a1ba0b93ba",
        "ObservabilityConfigurationName": "rest-api",
        "TraceConfiguration": {
            "Vendor": "AWSXRAY"
        },
        "ObservabilityConfigurationRevision": 1,
        "Latest": true,
        "Status": "ACTIVE",
        "CreatedAt": "2023-08-11T16:10:44.825000+02:00"
    }
}
```

This AWS CloudFormation template defines the infrastructure for a backend application deployed using AWS App Runner and exposes it via AWS API Gateway. Here's a breakdown of the major components:

1. **Parameters**:
    
    * `Environment`: Specifies the name of the environment (e.g., production or development) where this CloudFormation stack will be part of.
        
    * `ImageUrl`: URL of the Docker image containing the application process that will handle the traffic. It must be on Amazon ECR private registry.
        
    * `ObservabilityConfigurationArnParam`: ARN for the observability configuration, which can be created via AWS CLI.
        
2. **Resources**:
    
    * **AppRunnerRole (IAM Role)**: A role that allows the App Runner service to assume the role and interact with other AWS services. It also attaches the necessary managed policy for accessing ECR.
        
    * **Backend (AWS App Runner Service)**: Defines the App Runner service that runs the application from the Docker image, using specified resources, port, and health check settings.
        
    * **ApiGatewayRestApi (API Gateway REST API)**: The entry point for the API Gateway.
        
    * **ApiGatewayResource (API Gateway Resource)**: A wildcard proxy resource that forwards all requests to the App Runner service.
        
    * **ApiGatewayMethod (API Gateway Method)**: Defines a method that allows any HTTP method and integrates with the backend via HTTP\_PROXY.
        
    * **ApiGatewayDeployment (API Gateway Deployment)**: Deploys the API Gateway to a specified stage, allowing it to be accessed externally.
        
3. **Outputs**:
    
    * **AppRunnerServiceArn**: ARN of the App Runner service.
        
    * **AppRunnerServiceId**: ID of the App Runner service.
        
    * **AppRunnerServiceUrl**: URL of the App Runner service.
        
    * **IntegrationAPI**: The external URL for accessing the API, via the API Gateway.
        

The template is responsible for deploying a backend service through AWS App Runner, using a Docker image from ECR. It then creates an API Gateway to handle and forward HTTP requests to this backend. The infrastructure allows for observability through AWS X-Ray and provides outputs to access both the backend service and the API Gateway endpoint. The environment configuration is parameterized, enabling different settings for different deployment stages like development or production.

# Logs, Monitoring and Tracing to Support Observability

If you visit the App Runner console you will get access to all data about your backend:

# Finally Seamlessly updatable

> Note. You can use backend code in `tutorial/part8` folder

First step let's change the code to add the word `new` to String template:

```java
@RestController
public class GreetingController {
	private static final String template = "Hello, new %s!";
```

Let's build our backend:

```bash
$ ./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=spring-rest-api
```

And publish the new version to the private Elastic Container Registry:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-central-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 11111111.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
docker tag spring-rest-api:latest 111111111.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ias:spring-rest-api
docker push 111111111.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ias:spring-rest-api
```

Last step to trigger App Runner update:

```bash
aws apprunner start-deployment --service-arn arn:aws:apprunner:eu-central-1:1111111111:service/apprunner-restapi-production/31b931da83b74ec086d972207a5c788d
```

You can check for log in the App Runner console

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691768871148/245bcdaa-5722-4d35-9c1e-6f09d69d6f77.png align="center")

You can take App Runner Service ARN from the Output section of the Cloudformation stack.

After querying the API Gateway endpoint:

```bash
 curl https://inl76kdky9.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/production/api/greeting
```

You should get a "new" response:

```json
{"id":110,"content":"Hello, new World!"}
```

# Summary

This article provides a guide on deploying a backend application using AWS App Runner and exposing it via AWS API Gateway. It covers the creation of an AWS CloudFormation template, which defines the necessary infrastructure, parameters, and resources, such as IAM roles, App Runner services, and API Gateway configurations. The template supports observability through AWS X-Ray and enables seamless updates through code changes and deployment triggers. The article also demonstrates how to build, publish, and update the backend using a sample Spring Boot application.
