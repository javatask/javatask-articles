Implementing tunnel agent as AWS Greengrass custom component

# Introduction

In this part, I will show how to build a custom component for AWS IoT Greengrass that integrates with AWS IoT Secure Tunneling. Custom component will provide us with the missing part of tunnelling calls from the "local" Protocol Gateway (PG) to the remote instance of PG, deployed on the OpEdge Device. In this article, we delve into creating a custom component that leverages the [AWS LocalProxy](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-iot-securetunneling-localproxy) for tunnelling.

### **Project Overview**

Our project involves developing a Greengrass V2 component named "com.javatask.iot-tunnel-agent". This component, versioned at 1.1.5, is designed to establish a secure tunnel between AWS IoT and a local resource using AWS IoT Secure Tunneling and the LocalProxy software. We use Python as our primary development language because it's available out of the box.

My code is based on existing NodeJS example from AWS - [iot-secure-tunneling-demo/device-agent/src/index.js at master Â· aws-samples/iot-secure-tunneling-demo (github.com)](https://github.com/aws-samples/iot-secure-tunneling-demo/blob/master/device-agent/src/index.js)

I used [AWS IoT Greengrass Development Kit Command-Line Interface commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-development-kit-cli-commands.html) to improve the developer experience.

The AWS IoT Greengrass Development Kit Command-Line Interface (CLI) commands are a set of tools that improve the developer experience when working with AWS Greengrass. They help in creating, testing, and deploying Greengrass components and provide a streamlined workflow for managing IoT devices and applications.

This is what component configuration looks like:

```json
{
  "component": {
    "com.javatask.iot-tunnel-agent": {
      "author": "javatask",
      "version": "1.1.5",
      "build": {
        "build_system": "zip"
      },
      "publish": {
        "bucket": "xxx-sandbox",
        "region": "eu-central-1"
      }
    }
  },
  "gdk_version": "1.0.0"
}
```

Let's break down the key elements of this component:

1. **Component Name and Details**:
    
    * `"com.javatask.iot-tunnel-agent"`: This is the unique identifier for the component. In this case, the component is an IoT tunnel agent developed by `javatask`.
        
    * `author`: The creator of the component is `javatask`.
        
    * `version`: This particular version of the component is `1.1.5`. Versioning is important in software to track changes, updates, and fixes over time.
        
2. **Build Details**:
    
    * `build_system`: This is set to `zip`, indicating the format or the method used for building the component. It means that the component is packaged as a ZIP file.
        
3. **Publish Details**:
    
    * `bucket`: The AWS S3 bucket where the component is stored is named `xxx-sandbox`. S3 buckets in AWS are used for storing objects (files), and here it's being used to store this component.
        
    * `region`: The AWS region where this component is stored is `eu-central-1`, which is one of the AWS regions in Europe (specifically Frankfurt).
        
4. **Greengrass Development Kit (GDK) Version**:
    
    * `gdk_version`: This specifies the version of the Greengrass Development Kit used, which in this case is `1.0.0`. The GDK is a toolkit for building Greengrass components.
        

In summary, this JSON snippet defines a Greengrass component built and published by `javatask`. It's packaged as a ZIP file, stored in an S3 bucket named `xxx-sandbox` in the `eu-central-1` region, and was developed using version `1.0.0` of the Greengrass Development Kit. Components like this are crucial for building IoT solutions that operate on local devices.

### **Component Configuration**

The component's recipe specifies its functionalities and integration points. Key attributes include the component name, version, description, and lifecycle management details. The recipe outlines the default configuration, which includes a local pub/sub topic and necessary access control policies.

> **Note.** This component has two IPC polices, I'm showing them here to illustrate the granularity of security layers. These polices are intended to manage permissions to use MQTT for local communication with other components or local devices. Or with AWS IoT Core Cloud services.

Our component will listen to the MQTT topic for the message indicating initiation of tunnel creation.

```yaml

      aws.greengrass.ipc.mqttproxy:
        com.javatask.iot-tunnel-agent:pubsub:1: 
          policyDescription: "Allows access to publish to any topic."
          operations: 
            - aws.greengrass#PublishToIoTCore
            - aws.greengrass#SubscribeToIoTCore
          resources: 
            - "*"
Manifests:
  - Platform:
      os: all
    Artifacts:
      - URI: "s3://BUCKET_NAME/COMPONENT_NAME/COMPONENT_VERSION/iot-tunnel-agent.zip"
        Unarchive: ZIP
    Lifecycle:
      Run: "python3 -u {artifacts:decompressedPath}/iot-tunnel-agent/main.py"
```

This JSON snippet is a recipe for an AWS Greengrass custom component. Greengrass recipes define how components are configured, deployed, and run on Greengrass core devices. Let's dissect the key elements of this recipe:

1. **Recipe Metadata**:
    
    * `RecipeFormatVersion`: The version of the recipe format used, which is `"2020-01-25"` in this case.
        
    * `ComponentName`: A placeholder for the name of the component taken from GDK config file (`{COMPONENT_NAME}`).
        
    * `ComponentVersion`: A placeholder for the version of the component taken from GDK config file (`{COMPONENT_VERSION}`).
        
    * `ComponentDescription`: A brief description of the component, indicating that it demonstrates how to publish and subscribe to topics using IPC (Inter-Process Communication) operations.
        
    * `ComponentPublisher`: A placeholder for the author or publisher of the component taken from GDK config file (`{COMPONENT_AUTHOR}`).
        
2. **Component Configuration**:
    
    * This section defines the default configuration for the component. It includes a default message, a topic for local pub/sub operations, and access control settings.
        
    * `accessControl`: This is particularly important as it defines the permissions for the component in terms of IPC operations. There are two sets of permissions here: one for pub/sub operations within Greengrass (`aws.greengrass.ipc.pubsub`) and another for operations with AWS IoT Core (`aws.greengrass.ipc.mqttproxy`).
        
3. **Manifests**:
    
    * This section describes how the component should be deployed on various platforms.
        
    * `Platform`: Specifies the operating system. Here it's set to `all`, indicating compatibility with all operating systems.
        
    * `Artifacts`: Points to the location of the component's code or executable, which in this case is a ZIP file in an S3 bucket. The placeholders `BUCKET_NAME`, `COMPONENT_NAME`, and `COMPONENT_VERSION` should be replaced with actual values.
        
    * `Unarchive`: The method to unarchive the artifact, which is `ZIP` in this case.
        
4. **Lifecycle**:
    
    * Defines the commands to execute during the lifecycle of the component.
        
    * `Run`: The command to run the component. This example uses Python 3 to execute a script named [`main.py`](http://main.py) located in the decompressed artifact path.
        

In summary, this Greengrass component recipe defines a component that demonstrates IPC operations for publishing and subscribing to topics. It includes configuration details, access control policies, and deployment instructions, including the artifact's location and the command to run the component. The placeholders in the recipe need to be replaced with actual values before deployment.

### **Main Functionality**

The [`main.py`](http://main.py) script is the core of our component. It sets up a subscription to the tunnel notification topic on AWS IoT and waits for incoming messages. Upon receiving a message, it triggers the tunnel establishment process.

```python
import os
import sys
import traceback
import threading
import awsiot.greengrasscoreipc
from localpubsub import subscriber

thing_name = os.getenv("AWS_IOT_THING_NAME")
print("Thing name", thing_name)

def main():
    topic = "$aws/things/{thing}/tunnels/notify".format(thing=thing_name)

    try:
        ipc_client = awsiot.greengrasscoreipc.connect()
        # Subscribe to the topic before publishing
        op = subscriber.subscribe_to_topic(ipc_client, topic)
        # Publish a message for N times and exit
        event = threading.Event()
        event.wait()
        
        op.close()
    except Exception:
        print("Exception occurred", file=sys.stderr)
        traceback.print_exc()
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script is designed to act as a main file for triggering a tunnel agent in the AWS IoT Greengrass environment. Let's break down its key components and functionality:

1. **Imports**:
    
    * The script begins by importing necessary Python modules such as `os`, `sys`, `traceback`, and `threading`.
        
    * It also imports the `awsiot.greengrasscoreipc` module, which is a custom module provided by AWS for Greengrass Core IPC (Inter-Process Communication) functionality.
        
    * Additionally, it imports a `subscriber` from a local module named `localpubsub`. This `subscriber` is a utility for subscribing to MQTT topics.
        
2. **Environment Variable**:
    
    * `thing_name`: The script retrieves the AWS IoT Thing name from an environment variable (`AWS_IOT_THING_NAME`). This `thing_name` is used to identify the specific IoT device or resource in AWS IoT.
        
3. **Main Function**:
    
    * The `main` function is the entry point of the script.
        
    * It constructs a topic string using the `thing_name`. The topic `"$aws/things/{thing}/tunnels/notify"` is formatted to include the specific `thing_name`, which is used for subscribing to tunnel notifications.
        
    * The script then tries to establish an IPC connection with the Greengrass core using `awsiot.greengrasscoreipc.connect()`.
        
4. **Subscribing and Waiting for Events**:
    
    * Once the IPC client is connected, the script subscribes to the specified topic using the `subscriber.subscribe_to_topic` function.
        
    * After subscribing, it uses a `threading.Event()` to wait indefinitely. This is a common pattern in event-driven programming, where the script will wait for an event (like a message on the subscribed topic) to occur.
        
    * The use of `event.wait()` here suggests that the script is intended to remain running and responsive to incoming messages.
        
5. **Exception Handling**:
    
    * The script includes exception handling to catch any errors that occur during its execution.
        
    * If an exception is raised, it prints the exception details to the standard error stream and then exits with a status code of `1`, indicating an error.
        
6. **Script Execution Check**:
    
    * The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block checks if the script is being run directly (as opposed to being imported as a module) and, if so, calls the `main()` function to start the program.
        

In summary, this Python script is designed to run as part of an AWS IoT Greengrass setup. It subscribes to a specific MQTT topic related to tunnel notifications and waits for events. The script handles any exceptions gracefully and relies on environment variables for configuration. This setup is typically used in IoT applications where devices need to respond to messages or commands sent from the cloud or other devices.

### **Subscription Management**

In [`subscriber.py`](http://subscriber.py), I define the `SubscribeTopicHandler` class for handling incoming MQTT messages. This class listens for messages on the specified topic, and extracts tunneling parameters like `clientAccessToken`, `region`, and `services`, and then initiates the tunnelling process.

```python
import logging
import sys
import traceback
import json

from tunneling import tunnel

import awsiot.greengrasscoreipc.client as client
import awsiot.greengrasscoreipc.model as model

# Init the logger.
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class SubscribeTopicHandler(client.SubscribeToIoTCoreStreamHandler):
    """
    Event handler for SubscribeToTopicOperation

    Inherit from this class and override methods to handle
    stream events during a SubscribeToTopicOperation.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, message_callback = None):
        log.info('Initialising AWS Greengrass V2 IPC MQTT Subscribe Client')
        super().__init__()

        # Create ThreadPoolExecutor to process PubSub reveived messages.
        # self.executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=None) 
        self.message_callback = message_callback

    def on_stream_event(self, event: model.IoTCoreMessage) -> None:
        try:
            log.info('MQTT EVENT RECEIVED: {}'.format(event))

            topic = event.message.topic_name    
            message = str(event.message.payload, "utf-8")
            print(topic, message)
            
            python_variables = json.loads(message)

            clientAccessToken = python_variables['clientAccessToken']
            clientMode = python_variables['clientMode']
            region = python_variables['region']
            services = python_variables['services']
            
            log.info(clientAccessToken, region, services, clientMode)
            
            tunnel.start_tunnel(clientAccessToken, region, services)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Exception occurred: " + str(e))
            traceback.print_exc()

    def on_stream_error(self, error: Exception) -> bool:
        print("Received a stream error.", file=sys.stderr)
        traceback.print_exc()
        return False  # Return True to close stream, False to keep stream open.

    def on_stream_closed(self) -> None:
        print("Subscribe to topic stream closed.")

def subscribe_to_topic(ipc_client, topic):
    op = ipc_client.new_subscribe_to_iot_core(
         stream_handler=SubscribeTopicHandler()
    )
    op.activate(
    request=model.SubscribeToIoTCoreRequest(
        # topic_name="{}/subscribe".format(os.environ["AWS_IOT_THING_NAME"]),
        topic_name=topic,
        qos=model.QOS.AT_LEAST_ONCE,
        )
    )
    return op
```

This section of the code is responsible for subscribing to an MQTT topic using AWS IoT Greengrass V2's Inter-Process Communication (IPC) system. Let's break it down to understand its components and functionality:

1. **Imports and Logging Setup**:
    
    * The script starts by importing necessary modules like `logging`, `sys`, `traceback`, `json`, as well as custom modules `tunnel` and AWS IoT Greengrass core IPC client and model modules.
        
    * It initializes a logger for logging information and errors, setting the logging level to `INFO`.
        
2. **SubscribeTopicHandler Class**:
    
    * This class inherits from `client.SubscribeToIoTCoreStreamHandler` and is used to handle events received from the MQTT topic subscription.
        
    * The `__init__` method initializes the class, logging the initialization and setting up a callback for processing received messages.
        
    * The `on_stream_event` method is overridden to handle incoming MQTT messages. When a message is received, it logs the event, extracts the message content, converts it from bytes to a string, and then loads the message content into Python variables. It then logs some of these variables and calls the `tunnel.start_tunnel` function with them.
        
    * The `on_stream_error` method handles any errors that occur during the stream, printing the error to the standard error stream and deciding whether to close the stream (returns `False` to keep it open).
        
    * The `on_stream_closed` method is called when the stream is closed, and it logs this event.
        
3. **subscribe\_to\_topic Function**:
    
    * This function is responsible for actually subscribing to the MQTT topic.
        
    * It creates a new subscription operation (`op`) using the `ipc_client.new_subscribe_to_iot_core` method, passing in an instance of the `SubscribeTopicHandler`.
        
    * The `op.activate` method is called with a `SubscribeToIoTCoreRequest`, specifying the `topic_name` and the Quality of Service ([`QOS.AT`](http://QOS.AT)`_LEAST_ONCE`). This activates the subscription.
        
    * The function returns the operation object (`op`), which could be used for further interaction with the subscription.
        

In summary, the script sets up a subscription to an MQTT topic using AWS IoT Greengrass V2 IPC. It handles incoming messages by parsing them and performing actions based on their content, like starting a tunnel. The script is designed to be robust, handling errors and stream closures effectively. This kind of functionality is crucial in IoT systems, where devices need to respond to messages or commands sent from the cloud or other devices in real-time.

### **Tunnel Establishment**

The [`tunnel.py`](http://tunnel.py) script is responsible for starting the LocalProxy process. It takes the extracted parameters from the MQTT message and launches LocalProxy with the appropriate arguments. The script monitors and logs the LocalProxy's output for debugging and operational visibility.

```python
import subprocess
import threading
import logging

# Init the logger.
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def start_tunnel(clientAccessToken, region, services_array, client_mode):
    if client_mode != "destination":
        raise RuntimeError(f"Client mode {client_mode} in the MQTT message is not expected")

    if len(services_array) > 1:
        raise RuntimeError("Services in the MQTT message has more than 1 service")

    service = services_array[0]
    if service != "PG":
        raise RuntimeError(f"Service {service} is not supported")

    localproxypath = '/opt/lp/localproxy'
    # localproxypath = './bin/localproxy'
    argIotOptions = {
        'region': region,
        'token': clientAccessToken,
        'destination': '9876',
        'verbose': '4' # info, 5 debug, 6 trace
    }

    iotagent = subprocess.Popen(
        [
            localproxypath,
            '-r', argIotOptions['region'],
            '-d', argIotOptions['destination'],
            '-t', argIotOptions['token'],
            '-v', argIotOptions['verbose']
        ],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE
    )

    def handle_output(pipe, label):
        for line in iter(pipe.readline, b''):
            log.error(label)
            log.error(line.decode().strip())

    out_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_output, args=(iotagent.stdout, 'stdout'))
    err_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_output, args=(iotagent.stderr, 'stderr'))

    out_thread.start()
    err_thread.start()

    out_thread.join()
    err_thread.join()

    return_code = iotagent.wait()
    log.info(f'Process closed with return code: {return_code}')
```

This Python script is designed to initiate and manage a tunnelling process, typically in an Internet of Things (IoT) context, using subprocesses and threading. Let's analyze its key components and functionality:

1. **Logging Setup**:
    
    * The script sets up logging to capture and log informational messages and errors. This is crucial for monitoring the tunnelling process and diagnosing issues.
        
2. **Function** `start_tunnel`:
    
    * The core functionality is encapsulated in the `start_tunnel` function, which takes four parameters: `clientAccessToken`, `region`, `services_array`, and `client_mode`.
        
    * The function first checks if the `client_mode` is `"destination"`. If not, it raises a runtime error, suggesting that the mode specified in the MQTT message is not what the function expects.
        
    * It then checks if there is more than one service specified in `services_array`, raising an error if so. This indicates that the function is designed to handle only one service at a time.
        
    * The function further validates the service type, supporting only a service named `"PG"`. If any other service is specified, an error is raised.
        
3. **Subprocess Execution**:
    
    * The script constructs a path to the local proxy software (`localproxypath`). This path points to an executable that presumably establishes the tunnel.
        
    * The `argIotOptions` dictionary defines various options for the tunneling process, like the AWS region, access token, destination port, and verbosity level.
        
    * The `subprocess.Popen` method is used to start the tunnelling process as a separate subprocess. The arguments constructed from `argIotOptions` are passed to this subprocess.
        
4. **Handling Subprocess Output**:
    
    * The `handle_output` function is defined to handle the output of the subprocess. It reads each line from the provided output stream (either `stdout` or `stderr`) and logs it.
        
    * Two threads, `out_thread` and `err_thread`, are started to concurrently handle the standard output and error output of the subprocess, respectively. This is an efficient way to capture and log the subprocess's output in real-time.
        
5. **Thread Management and Subprocess Completion**:
    
    * The script waits for both output handling threads to complete using the `join` method.
        
    * After the threads have been completed, the script checks the return code of the subprocess using `iotagent.wait()`. This return code can be used to determine if the subprocess completed successfully or encountered an error.
        

In summary, the script initiates a tunneling process using a specified local proxy executable, passing in parameters such as an access token, AWS region, and verbosity level. It is designed to handle and log the output of this subprocess in real-time using threads. This setup is particularly useful in IoT scenarios where remote devices need to establish secure, controlled communication tunnels to other systems or services.

### **Integration with AWS IoT Greengrass**

To integrate this custom component with AWS IoT Greengrass, we package it as a zip file and specify its URI in the component recipe. The component is then published to the specified S3 bucket in the "eu-central-1" region.

### **Running the Component**

When deployed on an AWS IoT Greengrass core device, the component subscribes to the tunnel notification topic and waits for tunnelling requests. Upon receiving a request, it dynamically starts a secure tunnel using LocalProxy, enabling secure, remote access to local resources.

### **Summary**

This article explains how to create an AWS IoT Greengrass custom component that integrates with AWS IoT Secure Tunneling, using the AWS LocalProxy for tunnelling. The component, named "com.javatask.iot-tunnel-agent", establishes a secure tunnel between AWS IoT and a local resource. The article covers the component configuration, recipe, main functionality, subscription management, tunnel establishment, and integration with AWS IoT Greengrass.
